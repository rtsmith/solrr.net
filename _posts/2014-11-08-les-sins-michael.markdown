After a few rousing singles Toro y Moi's dancefloor-oriented moniker produces the debut album. 
The work moves across an array of sentiments employing solid song writing and hooks in all the right places. 
Areas of funky bits and classic house shuffles keep the head bobbing and the album as a whole cohesive. The unique 'ardcore vibes on "Call" and breaks on "Drop" are particular highlights.
